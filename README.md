# Data_Driven_Graph_Construction
CMI MSc DS | Linear Algebra and its Applications | Project 

## Introduction

1. This GitHub repository contains code and resources related to graph partitioning techniques.
2. The aim of this repository is to provide implementations and demonstrations of various graph partitioning algorithms.
3. Graph partitioning is a fundamental task in data analysis and computational sciences, with widespread applications in fields such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and computer vision.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of popular graph partitioning algorithms such as Spectral partitioning, k-means, and DBSCAN. Additionally, the repository contains sample generated dataset used for experimentation of conversion from tabular to graph data, which is then used to explore insights using clustering or partitioning.

## Usage

1. Users can clone or download the repository to their local machine.
2. The code is written in Python and can be executed in any Python environment.

## Algorithms

### Spectral Partitioning using Fiedler Vector
1. Implementation of spectral partitioning algorithm leveraging Fiedler's vector.
2. Provides functions for graph construction, eigenvalue decomposition, and clustering.
   
### K-means Clustering
1. Implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm for graph partitioning.
2. Includes functions for initialization, assignment, and updating cluster centroids.
   
### DBSCAN
1. Implementation of the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm.
2. Offers functions for core point identification, cluster expansion, and noise point detection.
   
## Datasets
1. Sample datasets are included in the repository to facilitate experimentation.
2. Datasets cover a range of scenarios including synthetic examples (e.g., circles, moons) and real-world datasets (e.g., karate network).
3. The following datasets have been used for experimentation,
  * Make Moons
  * Make Circles
  * Zachary Karate Club
  * Friednship Network
  * IPL Players' Netwrok
